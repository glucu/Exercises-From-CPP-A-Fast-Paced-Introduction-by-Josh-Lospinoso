#include <iostream>

/*  Create an UnsignedBigInteger class that can handle numbers bigger than
 *  a long. You can use a byte array as the internal representation (for example,
 *  uint8_t[] or char[]). Implement operator overloads for operator+ and operator-.
 *  Perform runtime checks for overflow. For the intrepid, also implement operator*,
 *  operator/, and operator%. Make sure that your operator overloads work for
 *  both int types and UnsignedBigInteger types. Implement an operator int type
 *  conversion. Perform a runtime check if narrowing would occur
